## Overview
This project explores the application of autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network, for dimensionality reduction tasks. Dimensionality reduction is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning and data analysis, aimed at reducing the number of features or variables while retaining essential information. By transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, dimensionality reduction methods enable efficient computation, visualization, and improved model performance.
